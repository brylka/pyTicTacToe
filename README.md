# Tic Tac Toe Backend API

## Description
This project is a simple backend that exposes an API for tic-tac-toe games. It was created for educational purposes to demonstrate the integration capabilities of various technologies in the context of lectures for students in fields related to the development of web and mobile applications. The backend allows for basic operations such as making moves in the game, however, it does not support the logic of checking wins, user management, and other advanced functionalities.

## What is it for?
The project serves as teaching material, demonstrating how to build a simple backend system to support a tic-tac-toe game. It is an example of how different technologies can be combined to create a functional application.

In addition to the backend, a web application (HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/Ajax) and a mobile application (Android Studio/Kotlin) were also created as part of the project. These communicate with the backend, enabling the gameplay of tic-tac-toe.

## Technologies
- Backend: A simple server application that handles the API
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax
- Mobile Application: Android Studio, Kotlin

## Launching
To run the backend, simply execute the `main.py` file. Detailed instructions on how to launch client applications are available in the documentation of the respective project parts.
